# Pac-Man Game

This project implements a simplified version of the classic Pac-Man game using the Java programming language with the Processing library. The game features Pac-Man (controlled by the player) navigating through a maze, collecting pellets, avoiding ghosts, and attempting to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Pac-Man Movement**: Pac-Man can move up, down, left, and right within the confines of the maze.
- **Pellets and Super Pellets**: Pac-Man can collect pellets scattered throughout the maze for points. Super pellets grant temporary invincibility and the ability to eat ghosts.
- **Ghosts**: Ghosts roam the maze and attempt to capture Pac-Man. Contact with a ghost results in losing a life.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded for each pellet collected and for eating ghosts while under the effect of a super pellet.
- **Lives System**: Pac-Man starts with a set number of lives. Losing all lives results in a game over.
- **Game Over and Restart**: The game ends when all lives are lost. Players can restart the game to try again.
